# Automate Your CSV Workflow with S3 Integration

**What’s New:** You can now connect the MCP server directly to your AWS S3 buckets to automatically retrieve and sync audit CSV files.

**Why It Matters:** This eliminates the manual effort of downloading and storing files locally, ensuring your governance data is always secure, current, and ready for analysis without extra steps.

**How it Works:** simply add your AWS credentials to the `.env` file and use the `sync_s3_files` command to pull the latest reports. [Learn More](README.md#3-s3-integration-optional).
